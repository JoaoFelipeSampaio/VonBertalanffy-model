# VonBertalanffy-model
Development of model applied to estimate growth curve of animals, using nls() function in R
This project is just a simple file how helped me to develop a von Bertalanffy model applied to Weight-Age data of bovine cattle. This can be generalized and applied to other species to, using the correct parameters in the function. Any doubt, just send me a message
